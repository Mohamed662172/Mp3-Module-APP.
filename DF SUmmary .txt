should be insert name as (0000.Mp3/Wav ~ 3000.Mp3/Wav)

 Ordinary folders must be renamed as 01, 02, 03......99, and the audio files must be renamed as
001.mp3/001.wav, 002.mp3/002.wav, 003.mp3/003.wav, .......255.mp3/255.wav. It is also possible to keep the

Length:  Number Of Byte  From (Ver. ~ Param_LSB ) Number of byte from version info to Check_LSB, typically 0x06 (checksum not counted)
CMD:Command Code 
Feedback :if i need fedback 0x01 /no feedback 0x00
Para_MSB:
Param_LSB 
Check_MSB
Check_LSB 
$O:End Byte 0xEF

. About Checksum
Regarding to calculating checksum, 
you can use the following formula to count. 
Checksum (2 bytes) = 0xFFFF–(Ver.+Length+CMD+Feedback+Para_MSB+Para_LSB)+1
